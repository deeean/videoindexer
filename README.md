# videoindexer
> Attention: This project is still in development and not ready for production use.

This project uses OpenCV for video frame extraction, PyTorch and ResNet50 to generate frame embeddings, and stores them in PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient similarity searches. It's ideal for building advanced video analysis and retrieval systems
